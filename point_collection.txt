ex2: 35 / 41
ex3: 17 / 17
ex4: 42 / 44
ex5: 10 / 11
ex6: 18 / 22

ex7: 15.5 / 25
1a) 6.5 / 8
missed bias everywhere (-2)
1b) 4 / 4

2a) 2 / 6
biases missing again -> rest did not work.
2b) 0 / 4
missing because a) did not work
3) 3/3

ex8:  34 / 48
1a) 0 / 5
1b) 0 / 5
due to unclear slides (confusion about problem size, input size, problem complexity)
Now I understand weak scaling as depending on problem complexity, not imput size !
2a) 12/14
offset mistake -1
worked with old template -> used N_ istead of real_N_ -1
2b) 12 / 12
difference of N_ and real_N_ again, but technically works
could of course leave away ghost cells at sides, but only minor overhead
2c) 4/6
used rho_tmp_ instead of rho_ -1
implemented reduction instead of using it -1
2d) 6/6

ex9: 32/39
1) 8/9
forgot to mention copying buffers for issued send! -1
2a) 7/8
did not use hint about MPI_REQUEST_NULL -> solution more convoluted but still correct
2b) 17/22
implemented reduce (naively) instead of using an MPI_Gather or MPI_Reduce -5

ex10: 25 / 26
1) 7/7
did not do anything about ghost cells, but mentioned they could be left out.
2a) 12/12
2b) 3/7
MPI_Init_thread in comments, but not code -2
3) 3 / 4 bonus
omp_set_dynamic(0) missing -1
thread safety was mentioned (even if not implemented)

ex11: 18/20
1a) 0/3
1b) 2/2
1c) 3/3
I used allreduce, that is maybe not optimal, but still works
1d) 2/2
1e) 5/5
but eehrm sorry, the master solution is really a bit too much capsulated.
Makes it hard to compare solutions...
1f) 4/5
some minor bug that prevented the saving for the case (i) to work properly -1
1g) 2/4 (extra)
got some reasonable measurements, but did not do the speedup plot properly
