I installed OpenBlas from:
http://www.openblas.net/
https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS

First it had to be installed. I installed it into "~/OPENBLAS"
Linking is explained here:
https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/User-Manual#link-the-library
You can look into the Makefile for the commandline.

It is multithreaded.
Info to multithreading:
https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/faq#multi-threaded

set number of threads:
openblas_set_num_threads(num_threads);
Apparently OpenMP and BLAS can conflict on multithreading, this has to be kept in mind!

Speed:
best sequential: row-wise: 42.2ms
my parallel: 59.1ms
BLAS parallel: 2.7ms
BLAS single core: 6.1ms

I really don't know what I did wrong with my parallelization.
The write-pattern should be ok for cache.
Maybe the read-patterns for B are not good, but I would need a completely different approach like blocking to make a difference for that.
