----------------------  Question 1:

Blocking receive makes sense, we can only do work once we receive the input.

But 'MPI_Send' can be blocking. It might not be for small values, but if it is it has bad consequences here.
If one of the other processes starts lagging behind, then the process 0 will have to wait until it is done. Only then can it serve the other processes that are simply waiting.
Since they are blocking they cannot even do something else.

But even worse: The process 0 will be sending messages to itself.
If this is blocking in both operations this will just end in a deadlock in the first iteration.

One solution would be to let process 0 send out asynchronously.
Then it can continue right away.
This way the dependencies between the processes is minimized, they can all receive new inputs as they like. (Provided the process 0 has already sent all these messages).
